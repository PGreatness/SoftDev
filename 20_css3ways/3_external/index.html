        <p>Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.</p>

        <p>We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too.</p>
